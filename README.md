# Predicting-Property-Maintenance-Fines

The aim is to solve one of the most pressing problems facing the City of Detroit - blight. Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process.

The idea is to identify whether a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket, using predictive modeling. All data has been procured from the Detroit Open Data Portal.
